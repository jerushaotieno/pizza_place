# Jay's Pizza Place
This is a web application allowing users to create and order for pizzas online and request for delivery to their preferred location.  

#### By Jerusha Otieno

## Description
This is a web application allowing users to order for pizzas by choosing the size, type of crust and the toppings to add to each of their pizzas. Users can add more pizzas to their orders if they want more than one pizza. They can also request for delivery at their preferred location at an extra cost or opt for self-pickup directly from the pizza place. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Visual Studio (VS) Code is a must have.
* It is mandatory that you clone the github repository.
* Use Go Live on VS Code.

## Behavior Driven Development 
* The application checks whether pizza size, type of crust and toppings have been selected.
* If they are not, the user is alerted and prompted to enter a valid value. 
* E.g: a user can only choose one type of crust or size for a pizza but multiple toppings depending on what they prefer.
* The web application generates a user's order depending on the details filled in.
* E.g: If a user orders only one pizza, it generates for that one pizza only. If they choose more than one pizza, it generates an order with more than one pizza ordered.
* Output for each user if they order and choose self-pickup should for example read “Thank you for ordering. Your order will be ready in an hour. Your total is: KES 2000.""
* Output for each user if they order and choose delivery should for example read “Dear Jay, Thank you for your order. Your order will be delivered to Kili Building, Nairobi CBD in an hour! Your total order total is KES 3550. We'll call you upon arrival."
