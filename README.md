## Description
My Akan Name is a web application allowing you to calculate the day of the 
week you were born depending on your birthday and gender after which it gives you your corresponding Ghanaian Akan Name for a taste of Ghanaian naming culture.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Visual Studio (VS) Code is a must have.
* It is mandatory that you clone the github repository.
* Use Go Live on VS Code.

## Behavior Driven Development 
* The application checks whether the date and month entered are valid. 
* If they are not, the user is alerted and prompted to enter a valid value. 
* E.g: the date in any given month should not be <= 0 or > 31 or month in any given year should not be <= 0 or > 12.  
* The web application generates a user's Akan name based on their gender.
* E.g: A female user with a result calculation of 1 should receive their Akan name as Adwoa matching the day Monday, whose index is 1. 
* Output for each user should for example read “My Akan name is Adwoa”.
